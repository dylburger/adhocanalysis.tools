## Evangelizing simpler data analysis

Everyone should be empowered to ask and answer the questions they need to do their job. 

Often, people don’t have the right tools, skills or data to ask those questions, so they have to bug someone else for answers. This wastes time for the person asking the question and the one doing the work. We need tools that enable everyone, especially the non-technical, to make smart decisions with data.

For most people, this tool is Excel. Excel is simple but powerful. It enables individuals with the power to do complex analysis themselves. It helps businesses who can’t afford to hire their own analysts to analyze the business themselves (and they know it better than anyone). As long as your business can be simplified to rows and columns of data, you can ask incredibly abstract questions.

But for a growing set of companies, Excel isn’t the right tool. The business might store its data in a database that Excel can’t connect to. The data might be so large Excel crashes under load. Or you might just have too many people working with data that they’re duplicating work, generating the same charts or doing the same analysis for different teams. You want to facilitate the sharing of this knowledge between teams.

At this stage, many companies hire analysts. The analysts take requests from the business, pushing them numbers, spreadsheets, charts, and emails that contain the insight they need. For questions that arise again and again, this work is critical. Every business should strive to automate the creation of data “slices” that must be constantly reviewed.

But novel questions arise daily. These questions can be esoteric, but urgent. The analysts drop everything, often running a custom query against their database to retrieve an answer. Individually, these ad hoc requests take little time. But in a day, you might receive 50 of them. The questions must be prioritized: some get answered late, others not at all. Those lost answers lose you business. Naturally, the business prioritizes its questions, often failing to ask those that could grow the business but aren’t pressing.

If only the business could query the database themselves - they could answer their own questions, on their own time, and we’d both get our jobs done faster. They’d also ask the questions only they think to ask (because they know the business better than anyone).

The business isn’t going to learn SQL, but they know Excel well. What if you had a tool to let users query the database without writing a line of code? These “ad hoc analysis” tools - [Looker](https://looker.com/), [Superset](http://airbnb.io/superset/), [SSAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Analysis_Services) and more - exist, and they empower people in the same way Excel did years ago. Some of these tools aren’t new, but we’ve reached the point where more businesses need them, and need to pay less for them. More businesses generate larger data, but still can’t afford to hire the analysts to analyze it.

This site evangelizes ad hoc analysis tools - tools that give the power of analysis back to the people. It will affirm the benefits of these tools for the business, analysts and data scientists alike. It will codify the principles that make an ad hoc tool truly business-friendly. And I hope it will encourage us to keep simplifying and improving these tools for ever broader use.
